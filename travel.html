    <h2>Travel History</h2>

    <h3><font color="blue">My Youth, 1987-2006</font></h3>
    <p><i>I was lucky enough to be born in London and spend my youth traveling and living around Europe and the UK. We moved to San Diego when I was 7 and my parents used Thanksgiving breaks to see the US.</i></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>France:</b> I was in love with France ever since I learned French in high school. The first time I saw Paris it was exactly everything it was supposed to be. I've been back many times since.</li>
